# Anti-spoofing

Detect pulse from face videos Based on C++, used dlib to detect face location. 

The proposed method is evaluated first on a 3D mask spoofing database 3DMAD to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting 3D mask attacks.
More importantly, our cross-database experiment with high quality REAL-F masks shows that the pulse based method is able to detect even the
previously unseen mask type whereas texture based methods fail to generalize beyond the development data. Finally, we propose a robust 
cascade system combining two complementary attackspecific spoof detectors, i.e. utilize pulse detection against print attacks and color 
texture analysis against video attacks.
